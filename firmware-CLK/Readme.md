## Configuration Parameters

The right side of the screen shows a navigation line to indicate the current position of the cursor in the menu. The navigation is not shown in the main (BPM) screen.

Whenever a parameter is changed, a small circle will be shown in the top-left corner of the screen. This indicates that the current settings were modified and not saved.

Due to encoder reads and screen update, expect some glitches in timing and waveform generation when changing parameters. The module will stabilize right after the parameter is set.

### Global Parameters

- **BPM**: Beats per minute, adjustable from 10 to 300.
- **Master Stop**: Stop or resume all outputs.

The small squares on main screen shows the status of each output. If the square is filled, the output is active. If the square is empty, the output is stopped.

### Output Parameters

Each of the four outputs can be individually configured with the following parameters:

- **Divider/Multiplier**: Set the clock multiplication or division ratio.
- **Output State**: Enable or disable the specific output.
- **Pulse Probability**: Probability of a pulse occurring.
- **Euclidean Enabled**: Enable or disable Euclidean rhythm generation.
- **Euclidean Steps**: Number of steps in the Euclidean pattern.
- **Euclidean Triggers**: Number of triggers in the Euclidean pattern.
- **Euclidean Rotation**: Rotate the Euclidean pattern.
- **Euclidean Pad**: Add empty steps to the end of the Euclidean pattern.
- **Swing Amount**: Adjust the swing amount for the output.
- **Swing Every**: Set the pulse interval for applying swing.
- **Phase Shift**: Adjust the phase of the output in relation to the master clock.
- **Duty Cycle**: Adjust the pulse width of the clock signal.
- **Level**: Set the output voltage level (only for CV outputs 3 and 4).
- **Offset**: Set the output voltage offset (only for CV outputs 3 and 4).
- **Waveform**: Select the waveform for outputs 3 and 4.

## Operation

### Interface

- TRIG: Optional Clock input (0-5V)
- IN1, IN2: CV input to control internal parameters (0-5V)
- OUT 1 / 2: Clock Outputs 1 and 2 (0-5V)
- OUT 3 / 4: Clock Outputs 3 and 4 which are waveform capable (0-5V)

### Setting the BPM

1. Use the encoder to navigate to the BPM setting.
2. Push the encoder to enter edit mode.
3. Rotate the encoder to adjust the BPM value.
4. Press the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Global Play/Stop

With the **PLAY** or **STOP** word underlined, press the encoder button to stop or resume all outputs. The individual outputs can still be stopped or resumed individually and will remain in the last state set.

### Output clock division/multiplication

Outputs can be configured to multiply or divide the master clock. The default value is 1x which means the output will be in sync with the master clock. The outputs can be multiplied up to 32x or divided down to /128 with some triplets and dotted notes in between in the "1.5" and "3" division and multiplier values.

1. Navigate to the selected output.
2. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
3. Use the encoder to select the desired divider value.
4. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Output Play/Stop

Outputs can be stopped individually. When stopped, the output will not generate any pulses. When master stop is activated, all outputs will be stopped and when master play is resumed, any stopped output will be kept stopped.

1. Navigate to the selected output.
2. Click the encoder to set the output to ON or OFF

### Pulse Probability

This is the percentage of probability that a pulse will be generated on the output. This is useful for creating random patterns or adding some variation to the output.

1. Navigate to the selected output.
2. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
3. Use the encoder to select the desired pulse probability in percentage.
4. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Euclidean Rhythm Configuration

Euclidean rhythms are made from an algorithm which takes a numbers of steps, triggers(HITS) which are active steps and rotation(RT) of this pattern and produces a rhythm based the on hits being as equidistant from each other as possible. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm> for more info.

Additional empty steps can be added to the pattern using the pad(PD) parameter. This is useful for creating more complex rhythms.

1. Navigate to the output selection item. Click the encoder and rotate to select the output to be edited. Click the encoder again to exit the output selection.
2. First setting enables or disables the Euclidean rhythm generation by clicking the encoder.
3. Select the Steps, Triggers and Rotation parameters, click the encoder to edit the values.
4. The pattern will be updated in real-time and displayed on the right of the screen. Euclidean rhythm allows up to 64 steps but only the first 47 are displayed. Rhythm steps are shown in columns, top to bottom, left to right.

### Swing Configuration

The outputs can have a swing pattern applied to them. The swing amount is in 1/96th of a note based on current BPM and the swing every is the interval between applying the swing. The swing amount can be set from 2/96th to 12/96th delay and the swing every from 1 to 16 pulses.

1. Navigate to the selected output. The first parameter to be edited is the swing amount.
2. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
3. Use the encoder to select the desired swing amount.
4. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.
5. Navigate to the selected output, the second parameter to be edited is the swing every.
6. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
7. Use the encoder to select the desired swing every value.
8. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Output Phase Shift

Outputs can have their phase adjusted in percentage in relation to the master pulse. This allows for phase shifting the output in relation to the master clock. The default value is 0% which means the output is in phase with the master clock.
An adjstment of 50% will shift the output by half a pulse width which means that this output will hit in the upbeats of the master clock (or an output with a 0% phase shift).

Just be careful with phase wraps as shifting an output phase by more than 50% with a duty-cycle bigger than 50% can lead to unexpected triggers.

### Duty Cycle (pulse width)

Duty cycle or width is the percentage of the pulse that remains high or low. The default value is 50% which means the pulse high cycle has the same lenght as the low cycle. The duty cycle can be set from 1 to 99% where 1% will generate a very short pulse and 99% a very long high pulse.

The alternative waveforms generated by outputs 3 and 4 can also have their shape modified by the duty cycle parameter. For example, a 50% duty cycle (default) in the triangle wave output will generate a perfect triangle wave, setting the duty cycle to 1% will generate a sawtooth wave and setting it to 99% will generate an inverted sawtooth wave. The duty cycle also affects the envelopes by shortening or lengthening the decay time during the pulse.

1. Select the duty cycle parameter for the desired output. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
2. Use the encoder to select the desired duty cycle value from 1 to 99%.
3. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Output Level and Offset

Outputs 3 and 4 can output CV values so they support setting the output level and offset which ranges from 0 to 100% corresponding to 0 to 5V.

1. Navigate to the selected output. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
2. Use the encoder to select the desired output level from 0 to 100% which corresponds to 0 to 5V.
3. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Output Waveform

Outputs 1 and 2 only support square waveforms which could be used as triggers, gates, clocking, LFOs. etc.

Outputs 3 and 4 can be configured to alternative waveforms and envelopes.

They support the following:

- Square: A square wave with adjustable duty cycle, level and offset.
- Triangle: A triangle wave with adjustable duty cycle, level and offset.
- Sawtooth: A sawtooth wave with adjustable duty cycle, level and offset.
- Sine: A sine wave with adjustable duty cycle, level and offset.
- Parabolic: A parabolic wave with adjustable duty cycle, level and offset.
- Logarithm Envelope: A logarithm envelope (starts at 0% raising to 100%) with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by clock pulses.
- Exponential Envelope: An exponential envelope (starts at 0% raising to 100%) with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by clock pulses.
- Inverted Logarithm Envelope: An inverted logarithm envelope (starts at 100% decaying to 0) with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by clock pulses.
- Inverted Exponential Envelope: An inverted exponential envelope (starts at 100% decaying to 0) with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by clock pulses.
- Noise: A random signal with adjustable level and offset. Continuous.
- Smooth Noise: A smooth random signal with adjustable level and offset. Continuous.
- Sample & Hold: A sample and hold signal based on noise with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by clock pulses.
- AD Envelope: An Attack-Decay envelope (no sustain while gate is held) with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by a CV input.
- AR Envelope: An Attack-Release envelope (sustain is held at max level while gate is on) with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by a CV input.
- ADSR Envelope: An Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release envelope with adjustable level and offset. Triggered by a CV input.

1. Navigate to the selected output option "Output 3/4 WAV". Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
2. Use the encoder to select the desired waveform. The waveform will be updated in real-time.
3. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.

### Envelopes

The module supports envelope generators for outputs 3 and 4. Refer to the Output Waveform section for more information on the envelope types.

The AD, AR and ADSR envelopes can only be generated by using triggers/gates on the CV inputs. They can have configurable curves between logarithmic, linear and exponential and also allow retriggering while the envelope is still active. The other waveforms (square, sine, etc) cannot be triggered by CV inputs.

To set an envelope generation, follow these steps:

1. Go to the waveform selection like in previous section and choose between "AD Env", "AR Env" or "ADSR Env".
2. Then, go to CV Input target configuration, select which CV input will receive the gate/trigger and assign it to the Output 3/4 Env.

Tip: You can have up to 2 envelopes running at the same time, one for each output receiving a trigger from each of the CV inputs. Each output can have a different envelope type, levels, offsets, curves and retriggering settings.

### Tap Tempo

In addition to setting the BPM manually, the module can be set to the desired BPM by clicking the encoder. The module will calculate the BPM based on the interval between taps.

1. Select the tap tempo parameter.
2. Press the encoder button at least 3 times to set the BPM based on the interval between taps. If more than 3 taps are entered, the average time between the last 3 is used. BPM is updated in real-time.

### CV Input Modulation

Many parameters can be modulated by the CV inputs. The CV inputs are 0-5V and can be used to modulate the BPM, output division/multiplication, pulse probability, swing amount, swing every, phase shift, duty cycle, waveform, level and offset.

Each input can be assigned to one of the parameters above. The CV input can be attenuated or offset by using configuration parameters.

1. Navigate to the selected CV Input parameter.
2. Click the encoder to enter edit mode.
3. Use the encoder to select the desired parameter to be modulated.
4. Click the encoder to exit edit mode.
5. Optionally, navigate to the attenuation and offset parameters for each CV input and set the desired values in a similar way.

The CV target only apply to the selected parameter when the user exit the edit mode. This way a connected CV to an input does not change the scrolled parameters while the user is selecting the target.

### Save/Load Configuration

The module has 5 memory slots to save and load configuration. The parameters saved into slot 0 is automatically loaded on boot.

1. Navigate to the PRESET SLOT parameter.
2. Click the encoder to enter the desired slot selection.
3. Click to exit the slot selection.
4. Select SAVE and click the encoder to save the current slot configuration.
5. Select LOAD and click the encoder to load the selected slot configuration.

The "LOAD DEFAULTS" option will load the default configuration to current parameters but will not save it. To save the default configuration, navigate to the save configuration parameter and save it to the selected preset slot.

### External Clock Sync

1. Connect an external clock signal to the designated input.
2. The module will automatically adjust the BPM to match the external clock. A small "E" will be displayed on the screen next to BPM when the external clock is detected.
3. When the external clock is disconnected, the module will revert to the last used internal BPM.

If the external clock is faster than needed (for example running at higher PPQN), it's possible to apply an external clock divider (from 1x, no division to /16) to the input signal in the Clock Divider section.

The module works with external clocks from 30 to 300 BPM. Due to timer resolution, using very slow external clocks with high multipliers may lead to jitter on the outputs.

## Firmware Update

1. Download the latest firmware from the Releases section of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VoltageFoundryMod/ForgeSeries/releases). The firmware file is named `CURRENT.UF2`.
2. Connect the module to your computer using a USB-C cable. The CPU can be removed from the module as it's socketed to the main board. Firmware loading can be done with the CPU removed.
3. Use tweezers or a jumper wire to quickly short TWICE the two pads labeled `RESET` on the back of the module CPU. The orange LED will flicker and light up.
4. Copy and overwrite the `CURRENT.UF2` file to the module USB drive named "Seeed XIAO" that will appear. After copy is finished, the module will reboot and the new firmware will be loaded.
